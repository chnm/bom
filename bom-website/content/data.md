The data for the Death by Numbers project has been manually transcribed out of photographs and digitized microfiche images of the original bills of mortality. To ensure that scholars are able to trace our transcriptions back to the original, archival sources, we have divided our transcribed bills into multiple datasets that are named and described according to the archive and call numbers where we found collections of bills. This is most apparent in the downloadable CSV files and can also be traced in the unique IDs for each transcription. For more on our project workflow, see our [methodologies essays](https://deathbynumbers.org/methodologies/).
