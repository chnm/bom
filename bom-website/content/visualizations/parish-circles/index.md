Explore the causes of death that were recorded in the monarchâ€™s bills between 1665 and 1669 in the interactive graphic below. Every circle is a different parish, with the smaller circles indicating the count and cause of deaths for each. The size of the circles corresponds to the number of deaths recorded, with larger circles indicating a greater sum and smaller circles indicating a lower sum. You can filter the results by year, or see a sum for the years 1665-1669, by clicking on the respective year in the filter bar at the top of the graph.
