This visualization illustrates the causes of death over time. The darker the shade of red indicates a higher number of deaths for a particular cause. Each column corresponds to a year in the database (listed on the x-axis label at the bottom of the graphic) and it's corresponding cause (on the y-axis). This graphic updates regularly as new bills are added to the database.
