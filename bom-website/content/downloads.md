We provide multiple ways to use and interact with the data generated through this project. The data can either be downloaded as a comma-separated value document (.csv) or accessed through the data API. 

The raw data exports are available [on our Github repository](https://github.com/chnm/bom/tree/main/bom-data/data-csvs). The README in the repostitory describes the contents of the datasets. These datasets are arranged as wide tables and are direct exports from [DataScribe](https://datascribe.tech). You may also consult the [data API's documentation](/api/) if you'd like to use the data directly. The data has been rearranged into a long format and returns JSON objects across weekly and general bills, christenings, causes of death, and foodstuffs.
