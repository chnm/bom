We find a lot of very specific deaths in the London Bills of Mortality
that are...well...meme-able. It isn't that death is funny, but rather,
the descriptions of death in the bills can be so that one can't help but
chuckle. And considering the heavy subject matter of our project, we
relish those moments. So, while our team took a well deserved break from
transcribing the bills, we shared "12 Days of Death" on [Twitter](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://twitter.com/PlagueBills&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1679501663865252&usg=AOvVaw0BXFQpQERpqzKM96c2vmDJ)

We had a great time making these memes, so we've compiled them here in
all of their glory for your viewing. We hope you enjoy them!
