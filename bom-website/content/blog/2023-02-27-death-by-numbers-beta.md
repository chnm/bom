Welcome to the relaunch of our blog and the formal beta launch of the
Death by Numbers database.

While our blog has been quiet, we've been busy behind the scenes getting
our code squared away and finishing transcribing some of the early
datasets so that the project was in a good place for a public debut.
We're still hard at work adding data to the database and building our
first visualizations, so don't be surprised at how large some of the
gaps are in the dataset. But we wanted to go public and give our
audience a chance to provide feedback on what we've created so far.

## Data

If you want to dive right into the graphical user interface for our database, it's now publicly available at [database.deathbynumbers.org/](https://database.deathbynumbers.org/).

If you'd rather download our data as CSVs, you can click the data link in the header to go to our [GitHub](https://github.com/chnm/bom/tree/main/bom-data/) where you'll also find our parish shapefiles.

Want to directly access our API instead? The instructions are at [deathbynumbers.org/api](http://deathbynumbers.org/api).

## Context

If you're interested in reading more about the project, check out our
newly redesigned blog (built in Hugo to ensure its long term
sustainability) which has all our old posts accessible via chronological
scrolling or tags in the sidebar of this page. Some great posts to get
started on include:
