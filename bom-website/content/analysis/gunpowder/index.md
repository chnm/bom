{{<alert text="This post contains descriptions of bodies after a gunpowder explosion and fire.">}}


In January of 1649/50, the city of London was still reeling from almost
a decade of civil war that had led to the beheading of King Charles I
less than a year earlier. Tensions between the Royalist supporters of
the new King Charles II and supporters of the Commonwealth government
were still high and war still raged in Ireland and Scotland. The old
king was dead, but the War of the Three Kingdoms was not yet over.

It was in this context that a ship-chandler by the name of Robert Porter
sold 27 barrels of gunpowder to the master of a ship. The barrels were
scheduled to be delivered to the ship on Saturday, January 5, so the
night before he brought 20 of the barrels from his warehouse down into
his shop in Tower Street---presumably to reduce the effort needed to
move them the following morning. What happened next is unknown: \"none
in the house was left alive to report\" whatever accident led to the
gunpowder being set alight, only the consequences thereof.[^1]

The bill of mortality for the week of January 1--8, 1649/50 was probably
the first printed record of the incident. In its usual laconic terms, it
reported that there were "Kild by the blast of Gunpowder 28. Twenty
five at Alhallowes Barking, and three at Alhallower Steyning.\"[^2] The
reference to *the* blast, rather than *a* blast, implies that everyone
who read the bill was expected to already know what blast was meant.
Indeed, there was nothing subtle about the massive gunpowder explosion
that took out 15 houses, made 26 more uninhabitable, and left \"at least
an hundred more much shattered shaken and defaced,\" including blowing
out the windows of the parish church.[^3] Everyone in the vicinity would
have immediately known it had happened and rumors would have flown
throughout the city from there.

The initial report was followed up a week later with more burials
recorded January 8---15: \"one by the fall of a peece of timber in
Tower-streete, and 27 by the blast of gunpowder, whereof 8 found at
Alhallowes Barking, and 18 more inhabitting within Preists Alley in
Towerstreete (besides strangers) lost in the fire taken up in
peeces.\"[^4] Although efforts to clear the rubble continued until
Wednesday the 17th, no more burials were reported on the bills.[^5]
Together, the bills put the confirmed death toll at 55, of whom 54 were
killed in the blast and the last taken out by a structural hazard
(falling timber) in its wake. But the second of the bills also makes
clear the contemporary uncertainty about the number of actual deaths:
there were 8 bodies found and buried in the parish of All Hallows
Barking, but there were also at least 18 inhabitants of Priest\'s Alley
in Tower Street who were \"lost\" and \"taken up in peeces.\"

Given the drama of the explosion---a fire coming from nowhere and
instantly killing a large number of people---it is perhaps unsurprising
that a subsequent pamphlet was published to provide more details on the
accident to a curious and anxious public audience. The pamphlet,
*Death\'s Master-Peece*, was printed for Francis Grove sometime between
late January and mid-March and provided \"A true Relation of that great
and sudden Fire in *Towerstreet, London*; which came by the fiering of
Gunpowder, on Friday the 4th of *January*, 1649.\"[^6] It provided
details on the accident; a list of the houses destroyed by the head of
each household that lived in those houses; a list of the dead by
household; a brief account of the firefighting efforts; and a financial
accounting of losses from the fire, estimated at a £60,000 which would
come to over £6 million pounds today.[^7]

The greater detail provided by the pamphlet allows us to gain more
insight on how the deaths were counted and recorded in the bills of
mortality. The initial damage from the blast took out "five fair
houses" belonging to a presumably high-status vintner named Mr.
Wormewell who is always listed first; the unfortunate ship-chandler
Porter; Mrs. Shaw, "a midwife of good esteem and quality;" the
shoemaker Mr. Bradley; and a pair of merchants, Mr. Charles Compton and
Mr. Woods.[^8] It also took out 10 houses "backwards from the street in
an Alley called *Priests Alley*" where the subsequent fire appears to
have raged longer and done significantly more damage. An additional 26
houses "were scattered and part beaten downe" but are not recorded as
having produced further casualties.[^9]

Of the people killed by the blast, 28 were killed in those "five fair
houses" and appear to account for the 28 bodies initially recovered and
reported on the first of the bills. Of these, 16 died in what was
probably a dinner party at the vintner Wormewell's house, including
"Gentlemen, Merchants, Tradesmen and diverse of very good quality, of
whom diverse were slaine, and many wounded." Three members of the
household also died, including "his wife, an apprentice, found dead
together, also a maid servant."[^10] All five people in the
ship-chandler Porter's house at the epicenter of the explosion
died---Porter, his wife, an apprentice, a maid, and "a
kinswoman."[^11] The widowed Shaw lost a maid, three grandchildren, and
her son-in-law, who was dramatically blown out of the house into the
church yard and died of his wounds. The shoemaker Bradley died along
with his wife and a servant, while the merchants' house was luckily
spared any casualties.[^12]

While the 28 victims in the "five fair houses" were accounted for
within a few days of the blast, it took another week to sift through the
rubble of Priest's Alley and indeed the recovery efforts continued for
almost two full weeks. It is in the pamphlet's recounting of the deaths
in Priest's Alley that it becomes clear how terrible the disaster was
and how difficult it was to account for the dead. The names of the heads
of households for those 10 houses were listed earlier, but there is no
separate account of the deaths in each house. Instead, the pamphlet
estimates the dead not by counting the bodies but by explicitly counting
the missing:

> there is missing 24. of the Inhabitants, which is conceived to be all
> destroyed and burnt, of whom there is only found some parts of their
> bodies, and of others bare bones, and other quite consumed, so that no
> other account can be given of them, but that they buried what parts of
> the bodies and bones they found among the rubbish.[^13]

At the end of recovery efforts, "the number buried that were not so
much disfigured by the fire, but they were known, some buried at *Barkin
Church*, and others carried home to their own places of abode, were 43.
and 24. which were so missing and found out be peece meal." But the
anonymous author of the pamphlet admits these 67 burials "is the number
that is yet known certainly to be kild" but not necessarily the total
death toll.[^14]

The destruction of Priest's Alley demonstrates at once both the
strength and the limitations of the mortality data published in the
London bills. Within days of the disaster, an accurate death count had
been produced from the "five fair houses" and published to let members
of the public get an initial glimpse into the magnitude of the disaster.
As recovery efforts went on, they meticulously tallied not only the
identifiable bodies in the bills but also explicitly flagged the
impossibility of recovering enough pieces to fully reassemble and count
or identify the dead, who could only be estimated as inhabitants versus
"strangers" who did not reside in Priest's Alley and could not easily
be known. At the same time, there are discrepancies between the bills
and the later pamphlet---54 blast deaths in the former, 67 in the
latter---with some bodies so destroyed that they could not be identified
*as* a body, and others carried away to other parishes---or even outside
the bills entirely---for burial. Despite a fortnight of Herculean
recovery efforts that cost another person their life from falling
timber, the true number of dead was fundamentally unknowable.

That this was no ordinary London fire can be seen by the discussions
documented in the House of Commons on January 9th--11th. On the
9th, Parliament ordered the Committee of the Army to confer with city
officials and determine how to avoid "all Mischiefs and Inconveniences
that may happen by Powder, and other combustible Matter, in private
Houses, and other Magazines, within the City of London."[^15] It is
probably only a coincidence that much of Parliament's business on the
following day focused on removing delinquents---that is, Royalists---as
well as "Papists and Malignants" from London, but deliberate enemy
action as well as accidents would have certainly been an underlying
concern when attempting to prevent future gunpowder incidents.[^16] The
explosion appears one last time in the records on January 11th, when
the Haberdashers were ordered to divert the first £200 out of an
outstanding fine of £2000 to aid "the most Necessitous of the poor
Persons, whose Houses were, by the late sad Accident, destroyed and
spoiled, in *Tower-street*."[^17]

Unsurprisingly, Parliament and the city officials did not take immediate
action to remove all gunpowder from London, and the dangers remained of
concern. A month later, on February 9th, the inhabitants of the Tower
Hamlets petitioned Parliament over the continuing danger of gunpowder
explosions. Parliament referred the issue to to the several militia
committees for the areas around London, demanding each" that they take
special Care, within their Precincts, of the Removing of Powder out of
private Houses and other Places, for Preventing of any Mischiefs, that
may be occasioned thereby" and report back in a fortnight.[^18]
