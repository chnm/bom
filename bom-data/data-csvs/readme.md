This folder contains datasets exported from the project team's DataScribe installation. Their file names include the export date, name of the collection of bills transcribed, and which part of the bill was transcribed.

Each file name contains 4-6 elements that describe the contents of the file.

1. xxxx-xx-xx (e.g. 2026-01-01) is the date the file was last updated
2. Bodleian, BL, Guildhall, Laxton, etc. is the name of the original holding library or collection that was the source of the transcribed bills
3. xxxx is an optional additional date to indicate a subset of the collection, e.g. just the year 1700 from the Laxton bills
4. weeklybills or generalbills indicates if it is a weekly or annual bill
5. parishes, causes, or foodstuffs indicates the type of data transcribed
6. additional naming elements are optional and provide ad-hoc details on the file contents

Holding Libraries and Collections:
weekly bill held at the Huntington Library in California (1635)
weekly bills held at the Bodleian Library, University of Oxford (mid/late 17th century)
weekly bills held at the Queens College Library, University of Oxford (mid/late 17th century)
weekly bills held at the Wellcome Library in London (late 17th century)
weekly bills held at the British Library in London (late 17th and early 18th centuries)
weekly and general bills digitized from the microfiche London Bills of Mortality, 1701-1829 by Paul Laxton (18th century)
general bills held at Guildhall Library in London (mid 17th century)
A. Millar's 1759 Collection of Yearly Bills of Mortality, from 1657 to 1758 Inclusive

Types of Data Transcribed:
"Parish" are the parish-by-parish listing of total deaths and plague deaths for each week or year.
"Causes" are the breakdown of total citywide deaths by cause of death.
"Foodstuffs" are the legal price of bread, salt or other foodstuffs.
Christening data is transcribed within parish or causes spreadsheets. Age data has not yet been transcribed.

Optional Details:
"Combineddata" indicate that Laxton bills transcribed under two different transcription conventions were normalized and combined
"DIRTYDATA" are bills that have been transcribed but not yet reviewed by a second team member and are likely to have a higher error rate than other datasets
"Preplague" and "postplague" indicate whether the bill has a second column for plague deaths or only a single column for total deaths
"Minus3foldbill" references a bill for 3 weeks of data that was published after the Great Fire of London

Most datasets use the "is illegible" flag to indicate when a piece of data is illegible or there was some doubt as to its correct transcription; the "is missing" flag to indicate when a parish does not yet exist on the forms; and both the "is illegible" and "is missing" flags when a piece of data is physically missing because a bill is torn or otherwise damaged.

If a data export does not contain flags, it uses an earlier transcription convention where the "is illegible" flag indicates when a piece of data is illegible or there was some doubt as to its correct transcription and the "is missing" flag to indicate when no data was printed for an extant parish or the parish did not yet exist on the forms. We did not export this flag data on these datasets to make it easier for users to determine which transcription convention was used.
