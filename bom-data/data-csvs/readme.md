Currently, the Bodleian and BL Weekly Bills Parishes datasets use the "is illegible" flag to indicate when a piece of data is illegible or there was some doubt as to its correct transcription; the "is missing" flag to indicate when a parish does not yet exist on the forms; and both the "is illegible" and "is missing" flags when a piece of data is physically missing because a bill is torn or otherwise damaged.

All other datasets use an earlier transcription convention where the "is illegible" flag indicates when a piece of data is illegible or there was some doubt as to its correct transcription and the "is missing" flag to indicate when no data was printed for an extant parish or the parish did not yet exist on the forms. Current data exports do not yet show these flags and we may hold off on updating the exports to show flags until after we have transitioned these datasets to the newer transcription convention.
