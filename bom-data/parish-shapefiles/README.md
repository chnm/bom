Parish shapefiles were generated in QGIS from a modern parish dataset retained in the Archived subfolder

These shapefiles only include parishes that were "Within the Bills" and thus do not include various liberties that were not recorded in the bills. For more on the geographical limits of the bills, see e.g. https://deathbynumbers.org/2022/02/28/parishes-and-extra-parochial-places/ and https://deathbynumbers.org/2022/03/14/within-the-bills-eebo-and-the-early-modern-london-metropolis/. The Tower of London only appears briefly in one set of 1730s bills but is retained on the basis that it was included then. 

The shapefiles are dated by the year in which parishes are created/changed. Someone working with the parish data from, e.g. 1700 should thus look to the 1694 shapefile as the most recent parish updates are included in that shapefile.

Parishes first added to the bills in the late 17th and early 18th century include:

St Paul Shadwell: week 16, 1671 (1670-71 year)
Christ Church Surrey: week 1, 1673 (1673-74 year)
