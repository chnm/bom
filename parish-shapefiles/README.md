Parish shapefiles were generated in QGIS from a modern parish dataset retained in the Archived subfolder

These shapefiles only include parishes that were "Within the Bills" and thus do not include various liberties that were not recorded in the bills. For more on the geographical limits of the bills, see e.g. https://deathbynumbers.org/2022/02/28/parishes-and-extra-parochial-places/ and https://deathbynumbers.org/2022/03/14/within-the-bills-eebo-and-the-early-modern-london-metropolis/. The Tower of London only appears briefly in one set of 1730s bills but is retained on the basis that it was included then. 

The shapefiles are dated by the year in which parishes are created/changed. Someone working with the parish data from, e.g. 1700 should thus look to the 1694 shapefile as the most recent parish updates are included in that shapefile.

N.B. St. Paul's Covent Garden may not be correct in the earlier 17th century shapefiles and will be updated once I've confirmed it should be merged to St Martin in the Fields in the pre-1645 shapefiles. If you find errors in the shapefiles, I would appreciate if you contact me - jotis2@gmu.edu - so I can correct them here.
